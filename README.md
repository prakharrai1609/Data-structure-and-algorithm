# Hey 🙋‍♂️ 
<h3 align="center">This repository is meant for data structures and algorithms .</h3>
<p>I will be updating this often and will include all the data structures important for interviews</p>
<ul>
  <li>My next update will contain trees</li>
  <li>My initial target is to make it one stop source for interview prepration so I'll avoid advanced stuff like segment trees and fenwik tree</li>
  <li>But I'll definately add them soon ;p</li>
</ul>
